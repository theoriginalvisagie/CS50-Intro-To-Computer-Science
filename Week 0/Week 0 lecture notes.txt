Video adds time to a sequace.
Audio gets represneted by a Midi.

Losless formats, no loss in onfromation, Lossy, throwing away some amount of quality.

Algorithm: Step by step instructions to solve a problem.

Programing is harnessing intuition to solve problems.

Psuedo code: expressing the code in a human language. High level steps to solve a problem.

There are commonilties between programming languages.
 - Functions: actions/verbes to solve smaller problems.
 - Conditionals: THis you do based on the answer to a question.
 - Boolean expressions: Yess/No answers.
 - Loops: Repeat the same instruction untill told to stop.

Describe functions as close to what they are used for.
